Template Driven Form
1.FOrmsModule

Reactive form or Model driven form
1. ReactiveFormModule
will have FormGroup

define structure of form in component class
we create the form model with FormGroup,ForControl and FormArrays. 
we also define validation rules int the component class. 
then we bind it to the html form in template 

FormGRoup
cr=new formgroup({})
the formgroup takes 3 args a collec of a child formcontrol, a validator and an asy validator. validators r optional




ngForm
1. binds itself to the <form> directive
2. creates a top-level FormGroup instance
3. creates FOrmControl instance for each of child control which has ngModel directive
4. cteates FormGroup instance for each of the ngModelGroup directive


Reactive form steps
1. new project
2. import ReactiveForm in app.module.ts
3. import {formcontrol,formgroup and validators} from '@angular/forms'
4. create obj for FormGroup() in component
create obj of FormControls inside FormGroup and array of validators
validators=[required,minlength,maxlength]


CRUD
service- common method tht can be reused


dependency injection- the data req in individual component that will be stored in the form of service class and the reference of this service class is injected in constructor

for service:
ng g s user

Crud Operation steps
1. Add service using ng g s serv
2. add components and add model user.ts declare variab
3. add array (data source or path of data source)
4. add method to retreive data
5. inject service ref in the const of components
