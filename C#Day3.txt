Types of classes in C#
1. Concrete class- it will have everything properties, constructor student class,product,employee
2. Sealed class- it cannot be inherited
3. Abstract class
4. Interface

3. Abstract class
i)Abstract class has some abstract methods
ii)We can't initiate abstract class meansno object created
iii)The class which is derived from abstract class must implement all abstract methods
iv)In any class at a time only one class can be inherited and implemented
v)To overcome this difficulty we take advantage of interface
vi)Abstract is in family

4. Interface
i)Interface is provider
ii)interface is not the family member of classes..it can be avail fr multiple classesS
