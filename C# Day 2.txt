Fcl-framework class library-use of collection of reusable types including classes
CTS(common type system) interoperability- taking the code from one language to another language
Common Language specification(CLS)- set of rules followed by a language
.NET Compliant Languages
-Key Features of .NET languages
-Standardized by ECMA(European Computer Manifacture Association)
-Component based
-Object Oriented
-Robust and durable code
-Array should be zero based

CLS and CTS
CTS and CLS r parts of .NET-CLR and are responsib

CTS- Common Type System - the datatypes can be used by managed code
Types of Applications
-Console Applications (.Exe files)
-Window Forms Applications(.Exe files)
-Web Form Application(.aspx, HTML pages)
-Data Centric Applications
-Components(.dll files)

clr load the code to RAm(Asssembly loader)
AL will load code to code verifier which verify conditions
then it loads to JIT compiler then it will be converted to native code(101010). Then the code is executed

cw 2 times tab

out is used to collect output from the main
assigning value to out will overridden
for calling ref variable must be initailized but not for out variable

//foreach only to display data not for taking input
foreach(string n in names)
{
cw("name:"+n)
}
//it iterates items in the collection
ref pass the value


Os is the manager which manages ram, cpu ,process of cpu

params
override
switchcase stmt to do arithmetic op- take input from user integer

This keyword refers to this instance of the class
also diff method paramweters and class fields if thy r same

it is used to call another constructor from a constructor in same class

Constructor- same name as class
no return data type
automatically initialized when object is created
